# plugin-animate-loaded-content-page
simple just need add class in file .html
In folder js, file initiate.js is plugin written to add animates to content when user load page.
Just add class to part which you wanna add animate, it will have efficiently.
_ add class 'loadToBottom' into content in .html file if you wanna content slowly drifting down.
_ add class 'loadToTop' into content in .html file if you wanna content slowly drifting up
_ add class 'loadToLeft' into content in .html file if you wanna content slowly drifting to the right
_ add class 'loadToRight' into content in .html file if you wanna content slowly drifting to the left.

=> In here, i have index.html file is demo add plugin animate loaded page.
Thanks all.
